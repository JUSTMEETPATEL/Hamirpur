 "Export" can refer to several things:

1. Exporting refers to the process of sending a product or service from one country or region to another for sale. This typically involves the transportation of the goods from the exporter's location to the importer's location.
2. In computer programming, "export" can refer to making functions, variables, or other entities available to other modules or programs. This allows them to be used by other code. For example, in JavaScript, you might have a module that exports a function for use in another module.
3. Exporting can also refer to the act of leaving one's native country or culture to live and work elsewhere. This can be a temporary or permanent move, and may involve adapting to new customs and traditions.
4. In ecology, "export" can refer to the process by which energy is transferred from one trophic level to another. For example, when an animal eats another animal, it is exporting the energy it obtained from its prey.
